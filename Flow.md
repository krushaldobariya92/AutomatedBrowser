# AutomatedBrowser Development Flow

This document tracks the development process of the AutomatedBrowser project, including the key decisions, implementations, and their rationales.

## 1. Project Initialization

### Initial Setup
- Created a basic Electron application structure
- Added essential dependencies:
  - `electron`: Core framework for building desktop applications with web technologies
  - `@cliqz/adblocker-electron`: Ad-blocker integration for privacy
  - `node-fetch`: HTTP client for JavaScript
- Initialized git repository for version control

### Key Design Decisions
- **Vertical Tabs**: Chose a vertical tab layout (on the left side) for better space utilization, especially with multiple tabs
- **Privacy-First Approach**: Implemented HTTPS enforcement and ad-blocking out of the box
- **Three-Panel Layout**: Designed with tabs on the left, content in the center, and assistant (Zak) on the right

## 2. Core Browser Implementation

### Browser Features
- **Multi-tab browsing**: Ability to create and switch between tabs
- **URL Navigation**: Address bar for direct URL input
- **WebView**: Using Electron's webview for secure content display
- **Security Features**: HTTPS enforcement and ad-blocking integration

### Technical Implementation
- Used Electron's `BrowserWindow` for the main application window
- Implemented a secure webview with appropriate permissions
- Set up event listeners for navigation (forward/back/refresh)
- Added a tab management system in the renderer process

### Challenges Addressed
- Fixed issues with URL navigation not responding
- Resolved problems with search functionality
- Implemented proper event handling for navigation within pages

## 3. Zak Assistant Integration

### Assistant Features
- **Text Command Interface**: UI for entering text commands
- **Basic Navigation Commands**: Support for actions like "go to", "search for", etc.
- **Command History**: Display of previous commands and responses
- **Page Status Updates**: Notifications about page loading status

### Technical Implementation
- Created a sidebar interface for Zak using HTML/CSS
- Implemented command parsing logic in JavaScript
- Set up IPC (Inter-Process Communication) for backend operations
- Added event listeners to update Zak's responses based on browser events

### Design Decisions
- Opted for text-based input rather than voice for simplicity and reliability
- Integrated Zak directly into the main window rather than as a separate overlay
- Used a chat-like interface for command history to provide context

## 4. Workflow Automation System (Current Implementation)

### Automation Features
- **Workflow Recording**: Record browser interactions for later playback
- **Action Capturing**: Track clicks, form inputs, navigation, etc.
- **Workflow Management**: Save, load, and delete recorded workflows
- **Playback Engine**: Execute recorded steps in sequence

### Technical Implementation
- Created a workflow management system in the main process (`src/main/workflows.js`)
- Implemented UI for recording and playing workflows (`src/renderer/workflows-ui.js`)
- Added file-based storage for saving workflows between sessions
- Integrated with the browser UI through a dedicated button and panel

### Architecture Decisions
- **Main-Renderer Split**: Separated workflow logic between processes
  - Main process: Core workflow management, storage, execution control
  - Renderer process: UI, recording triggers, playback visualization
- **Non-Intrusive Design**: Workflows panel appears only when needed
- **File-Based Storage**: Used JSON storage for simplicity and portability

### Implementation Details
- **Recording**: Capturing DOM events and navigation
- **Playback**: Using JavaScript to simulate user actions
- **Storage**: File system operations with proper error handling
- **UI**: Modal dialog approach for workflow management

```

### Version Control Approach
- Using Git for tracking changes
- Structured commits with descriptive messages
- GitHub repository for backup and collaboration

## 6. Future Development Plans

### Immediate Next Steps
- **Testing Workflow System**: Testing the recording and playback functionality
- **Bug Fixes**: Addressing any issues found during testing
- **User Experience Refinements**: Improving UI feedback during recording

### Medium-Term Goals
- **Smart Workspace Management**: Implement context-based workspace organization
- **DeepSeek R1 Integration**: Add AI capabilities to Zak
- **Self-Organizing Bookmarks**: Create intelligent bookmark management

### Long-Term Vision
- **Advanced Workflow Automation**: Complex workflows with conditional logic
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learning from user behavior
- **Performance Optimization**: Memory and CPU usage improvements

## 7. Technical Decisions Log

### [2024-03-09] Initial Browser Implementation
- **Decision**: Used vertical tabs instead of horizontal
- **Rationale**: Better screen space utilization, especially with many tabs
- **Impact**: Distinctive UI that provides more visible tab information

### [2024-03-09] Text-Based Zak Interface
- **Decision**: Implemented text commands instead of voice
- **Rationale**: Simpler implementation, more reliable, faster development
- **Impact**: More predictable user experience, easier debugging

### [2024-03-09] Workflow Automation Architecture
- **Decision**: Split between main and renderer processes
- **Rationale**: Security, performance, and separation of concerns
- **Impact**: More maintainable code, better error isolation

### [2024-03-09] File-Based Workflow Storage
- **Decision**: Used JSON files for workflow storage
- **Rationale**: Simple implementation, human-readable format, no database dependencies
- **Impact**: Easy debugging and manual editing if needed
